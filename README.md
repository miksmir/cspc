## Compressed Sensing-Based Compression and Reconstruction of 3D Point Clouds using Multilevel Wavelet Decomposition.

Brief Description: This is a work-in-progress Python library that processes 3D LiDAR Point Clouds (as .las file extension)
and performs compressed sensing-based compression using Discrete Cosine Transforms and Discrete Wavelet
Transforms and l1 minimization for reconstruction.

This is part of my master's thesis research.

### NOTE: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
