## Compressed Sensing-Based Compression and Reconstruction of 3D Point Clouds using Multilevel Wavelet Decomposition.

<p> This is a work-in-progress Python library that processes 3D LiDAR Point Clouds (as .las file extension)
and performs compressed sensing-based compression using Discrete Cosine Transforms and Discrete Wavelet
Transforms and l1 minimization for reconstruction. </p>

This is part of my master's thesis research.

### NOTE: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

### Dependencies
- Python (Version 3.10.10)
- Pip
- Conda

### Installation/Configuration on Windows:
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/miksmir/cspc.git`
2. Navigate to the config directory and change the prefix line in environment.yml to the location of your Python virtual environments.
3. Create a new virtual environment with all of the package dependencies by running `conda env create -f environment.yml -n <my_custom_environment_name>` in the Anaconda/conda terminal with your desired environment name.
4. In the config directory, modify the paths in config.json with your desired paths for reading/writing LAS files and writing simulation outputs.
5. Activate the newly created virtual environment with `conda activate <my_custom_environment_name>`
6. Navigate to the src directory and run any of the files.

### Known Issues:
- Since conda's autogenerated environment.yml file was generated on Windows, the environment.yml may not be imported properly on Linux. Installing the required dependencies may require manual installation.
